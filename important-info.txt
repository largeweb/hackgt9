React Structure
src/ has pages and components
in react, components can be inside other components
generally you want entire pages made up of other smaller components (ie home page has header component, button components, etc)
but components are components, you can design the component tree however you like

ROUTING
src/index.js has the routing, in the example, the <Link> tag is a React component that allows you to change server endpoint
checkout the examples, feel free to change the name of the endpoints (ie page2 and cool-page), but be sure to change corresponding buttons that link there
you can also change the name of the pages, but also change the import statements accordingly, and then the page js files, change the function name and bottom export

Bugs
when you install from your machine with npm (ie npm i fs), this updates your LOCAL package.json AND installs the package inside node_modules
node_modules is in .gitignore so when the server pulls from cron, it only pulls the package.json changes. you still need to npm i the package on the server
this could just be 'npm i' (as the new packages are in package.json)
sometimes, for some reason, type the package name 'npm i fs'
also, if you get package.json errors on the server, do: (in dir with package.json)
git checkout HEAD -- package*
this will update package,json on the server
if you still get issues, reset the entire server to latest commit
git reset --hard
‚ùó DO NOT PUSH CHANGES FROM THE SERVER
this causes so much annoying bugs

worst case scenario, just rm -rf the entire hackgt dir on the server end, and git clone it again, npm i again, don't touch anything else server end

pushing to production is tricky, this is why i have jerry rigged cron tab, it has its own random problems

feel free to find your own solutions, as long as we stick to react im happy to work with it, please no react native

any issues, blank screen etc, go on browser version and inspecct element, view console

otherwise the error messages that display pretty solid
